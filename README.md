In this project, a pair of 3D earbuds is designed with details and it is going to be turned into a promotional website. I used HTML, SCC, SASS, JS to code this page. I also used GSAP to make it more user-friendly and fun.


## Installation
The earbuds was first designed in C4D and with the help of https://modelviewer.dev/editor/ website I added some hotspost that shows different parts of the earbuds. HTML, CSS, SASS and javascript was used in coding the website. The HTML was used to write the content of the page, CSS and SASS was used to layout the layout as well as give some response to the website and JavaScript was used for the purpose of displaying the earbuds component information. This website was made to perfectly to suite three different devices that is Desktop (1920 and 1200 ), Tablet (768) and Mobile (320).

## Usage

By clicking on the screen and rotating, you can see the entire outer body of the earbuds in 3D. Also, by clicking on each hotspot, the detailed description of the earbuds components will be shown.
