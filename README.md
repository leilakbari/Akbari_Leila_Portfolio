# Akbari_Leila_Portfolio

This website is designed as a portfolio where I introduce myself and tell about my interests and add my selected portfolios. By clicking on each project, its details and the process that has been completed will be displayed. Companies and individuals can communicate with me by placing communication channels including my email and social media accounts.
I will have a total of five separate pages, including the homepage and about me, and three pages for my chosen projects. 
For the website home page, by clicking on the scrolling button, the page would move horizontally and goes to the about me page and if you keep scrolling you will see the selected my projects. By clicking on the view button on each project which would lead you to a new page, you can scroll vertically to read more the information and the process of the project. 
On the about me page, I explained more about myself and by clicking on the Read More button it will lead to a new page that you can read more about me and my interests.
In the footer that is fixed, my email and links to my resume and social media (Dribbble and LinkedIn) will placed. For the mobile and tablet versions, all pages can be scrolled vertically, and a new page opens by clicking on each button.
